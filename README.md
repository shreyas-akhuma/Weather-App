# Weather-App
1. Displays a 7-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures, and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. 
2. I have used fake, hard-coded data. You can use real time data by signing up for an API at https://openweathermap.org/ .
3. Click on a day, and see its hourly forecast. 
4. The project is built on React so ,to run it:\
  a. cd to the location where you have stored the project.\
  b. enter into terminal "npm start"
5. You may want to install bootstrap and react-linechart before running the project:\
  bootstrap : npm i bootstrap@4.5.0\
  react-linechart : npm install react-linechart --save
